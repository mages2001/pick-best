### Does Axios Resolve Cross-Origin (CORS) Issues?

No, **Axios itself does not resolve CORS issues**. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature, and the handling of CORS is enforced by the browser, not by Axios or other HTTP libraries.

If you encounter CORS issues when making requests with Axios:
1. **Server-Side Proxy**: Set up a server-side proxy to make the requests on behalf of the client.
2. **CORS Headers**: Ensure the target server allows your domain in its `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.
3. **CORS Proxy**: Use a CORS proxy like [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) for development purposes (not recommended for production).
